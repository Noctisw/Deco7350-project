DECO 7350 project(Waste sorting)

We are team cupcakes, this our github project. We designed a web application on mobile device. The goal of the app is to help people do waste sorting and we pay more attention to the help on the awareness stage which is to encourage people to persist on sorting waste. Also our app can help people track their waste mangement.

We put most of our work in the wiki page including the problem space, initial requirement, design concept and process, prototypes, evalution and the future plan.

We have totally three prototypes: 1. wireframe(wiki page). 2. interactive medium-fidelity prototype(wiki, link to Adoube XD). 3. Final demo(code play) 
We made the final demo use html,css and javascript, and it is only the front-end part. We did not make the back-end. To have a better display, we suggest download all the files in "Code" and put them into ont folder. Use google chrome to open the html file and set the dispaly size of iphone XR. The login is the first page. Hope you enjoy it!
